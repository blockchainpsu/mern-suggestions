# Creating a Web Application.

## Dependencies

This project will be generated through `create-react-app`, for simplicity's sake. To do so, run the following commands with administrator priviledges:

```
npm install -g create-react-app
npx create-react-app suggestion-app
```

After the commands finish running, `cd` into the app's directory and install the following packages:

```
// TODO: Add dependencies here.
npm install bulma react-router-dom --save

// For backend: 
npm install express cors mongoose
```
